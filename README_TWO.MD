## 📝 Instructions

Before installing jest, we have to initialize the project with the npm init commant ideal to setup NPM. 

Run the following command to start your project using npm package manager:

```bash
$ npm init -y
```

Note: If you don't add the `-y` option it will ask lots of questions that we don't need.

## 📝 Installation

When using the NPM package manager, you can install any 3rd party package or library (like jest, react, angular, etc.) by running the following command:

```bash
$ npm install <your_package_name> --save
```

Note: you have to replace `<your_package_name>` with the name of your package, in our case:

```bash
$ npm install jest --save
```

Note: if you don't include `--save` it will not be installed properly.
